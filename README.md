# Monokai Night Vim

![](https://i.imgur.com/sLXBvv7.png)

This theme is a modified version of [Ayu theme](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-vim). I just changed the background to `#1F1F1F` so it plays well with my [iTerm Monokai Night theme](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/iterm#readme).

## Install

Using [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```VimL
Plug 'nikitavoloboev/vim-monokai-night'
"...
colorscheme monokai-night
```

## Monokai Night family

This theme has been ported to [many other apps](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/design/monokai-night-themes).
